        <h1>ByteChain Testnet Alpha Whitepaper</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>ByteChain Testnet Alpha is the initial test network of ByteChain, aimed at improving blockchain scalability and accessibility. The primary focus is on efficient transaction validation, reducing latency, and enhancing decentralization.</p>
        
        <h2>Transaction Processing & Balance Calculation</h2>
        <p>ByteChain uses an address-to-balance mapping system for transaction validation. When a sender initiates a transaction, the node immediately deducts the amount from the senderâ€™s balance but does not credit it to the recipient until the block is mined.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional blockchains, ByteChain allows users to perform multiple transactions without waiting for prior ones to be confirmed. This feature enhances usability and transaction throughput.</p>
        
        <h2>Wallet-to-Node Communication</h2>
        <p>Wallets send transactions to a ByteChain node using an HTTP request. The node verifies the transaction, adds it to the mempool, and propagates it to other peers. This ensures transaction integrity before block mining.</p>
        
        <h2>Node-to-Node Communication</h2>
        <p>Nodes communicate using WebSockets, forming a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Transactions and newly mined blocks are propagated across nodes for synchronization and consensus.</p>
        
        <h2>Node Registration via Firebase</h2>
        <p>ByteChain utilizes Firebase for node bootstrapping. Nodes register by submitting their blockchain address and public key to Firebase. Once registered, nodes are assigned random peers, initiating initial connections. After this, nodes exchange peer information among themselves, ensuring a fully decentralized network.</p>
        
        <h2>Security Measures</h2>
        <p>ByteChain prevents double-spending by ensuring that deducted balances are not credited until transaction confirmation. The network also employs cryptographic verification and consensus mechanisms to maintain integrity.</p>
        
        <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
        <p>ByteChain aims to improve transaction latency by optimizing balance updates, enhancing node discovery, and refining consensus mechanisms.</p>
